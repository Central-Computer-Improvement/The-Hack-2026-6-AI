# DeepTutor — Agent-Native Architecture

## Overview

DeepTutor is an **agent-native** intelligent learning companion organized
around a two-layer plugin model — single-shot **Tools** invoked by the
LLM, and multi-stage **Capabilities** that take over a turn — exposed
through three entry points: CLI, WebSocket API, and Python SDK.

## Architecture

```
Entry Points:  CLI (Typer)  |  WebSocket /api/v1/ws  |  Python SDK
                    ↓                   ↓                   ↓
              ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │              ChatOrchestrator                    │
              │   routes UnifiedContext → selected Capability    │
              │   (defaults to `chat`)                           │
              └──────────┬──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                         │              │
              ┌──────────▼──┐  ┌────────▼──────────┐
              │ ToolRegistry │  │ CapabilityRegistry │
              │  (Level 1)   │  │   (Level 2)        │
              └──────────────┘  └────────────────────┘
```

All capabilities emit on a shared `StreamBus`; the orchestrator fans
events out to consumers. Runtime settings live in
`data/user/settings/*.json` — project-root `.env` files are intentionally
ignored.

### Level 1 — Tools

Single-function tools the LLM picks on demand. Four user-toggleable tools
surface in `/settings/tools`:

| Tool           | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorm`   | Breadth-first idea exploration with rationale |
| `web_search`   | Web search with citations                     |
| `paper_search` | arXiv preprint search                         |
| `reason`       | Dedicated deep-reasoning LLM call             |

The rest are **context-gated**: the chat capability auto-mounts them from
`ToolMountFlags` (presence of a KB, attachments, sandbox availability, …), and
any of them can also be force-enabled via `--tool`. Auto-mounted set: `rag`,
`read_source`, `read_memory`, `write_memory`, `read_skill`, `load_tools`,
`exec`, `code_execution` (sandboxed Python: NL intent → code → run),
`list_notebook`, `write_note`, `web_fetch`, `github`, `cron`,
`ask_user` (pauses the turn and resumes with the user's reply), plus the
mastery-path tools. `geogebra_analysis` is parked under
`COMING_SOON_TOOL_TYPES`.

### Level 2 — Capabilities

Multi-stage pipelines that own the turn:

| Capability       | Stages                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat`           | exploring → responding (single agentic loop, default) |
| `mastery_path`   | responding (Guided Learning — chat loop + mastery tools, gated per topic type) |
| `deep_solve`     | planning → reasoning → writing                        |
| `deep_question`  | ideation → generation                                 |
| `deep_research`  | rephrasing → decomposing → researching → reporting    |
| `visualize`      | analyzing → generating → reviewing (SVG / Chart.js / Mermaid / HTML; or routes to Manim sub-stages via `render_type`) |
| `math_animator`  | concept_analysis → concept_design → code_generation → code_retry → summary → render_output |

All capabilities converge on `emit_capability_result()` in
`deeptutor/capabilities/_shared.py` so every turn emits the same envelope
(response payload + `cost_summary` from `UsageTracker`). Status copy and
prompts are i18n'd via `capabilities/prompts/{en,zh}/<name>.yaml`.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Install
pip install deeptutor      # Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  # CLI-only

# Run any capability
deeptutor run chat "Explain Fourier transform"
deeptutor run deep_solve "Solve x^2=4" -t rag --kb my-kb
deeptutor run visualize "Animate sine wave" --config render_mode=manim_video

# Interactive REPL
deeptutor chat
# (inside the REPL: /regenerate or /retry re-runs the last user message)

# Partners (IM-connected companions)
deeptutor partner list

# Knowledge bases, memory, server
deeptutor kb list
deeptutor kb create my-kb --doc textbook.pdf
deeptutor memory show
deeptutor serve --port 8001       # API server only
deeptutor start                   # backend + frontend together
```

## Dependency Layers

Public install paths and source extras are defined in `pyproject.toml`.
Requirements files mirror the same dependency groups for Docker/CI installs.

```
pip install deeptutor      — Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  — CLI-only (LLM + RAG + providers + document parsing)
pip install -e .           — Source install for development

Source extras (.[ extra ], defined in pyproject.toml):
.[cli]            — CLI-only dependency set
.[server]         — Web/API server dependencies
.[partners]       — Partner channel SDKs + MCP client  (legacy alias: .[tutorbot])
.[matrix]         — Matrix channel for Partners (matrix-nio; needs libolm)
.[matrix-e2e]     — Matrix with end-to-end encryption (matrix-nio[e2e])
.[math-animator]  — Manim addon (powers `visualize` Manim renders + `deeptutor run math_animator`)
.[dev]            — Test / lint tooling
.[all]            — Everything above
```
## Implemented Microservice Features

### Course Telemetry and Diagnostic Evaluation Pipeline

The Course Telemetry and Diagnostic Evaluation Pipeline acts as the primary integration bridge between external Main Application Backends and DeepTutor's internal Three-Layer Memory System. It processes student learning activities, grades diagnostic quizzes, extracts distractor misconceptions, and logs structured trace events for personalization.

1. System Architecture and Trace Emission:
   - All course endpoints are stateless REST APIs located under /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/.
   - Activity events are structured into TraceEvent objects and emitted into L1 Trace Memory (data/user/memory/trace/<surface>/<date>.jsonl).
   - Events emit to dual surfaces (surface="chat" for Socratic Tutor context and surface="quiz" for L2/quiz.md memory consolidation).
   - Session auto-creation ensures SQLite database sessions (course_{course_id}) are automatically initialized prior to notebook upserts.

2. Video Lecture Tracking (POST /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/track_video):
   - Receives video completion payloads containing video_id, title, kb_tags, and kb_concepts.
   - Emits a video_watched event to L1 chat trace containing formatted Knowledge Base concepts.
   - Persists narrative event records to local session history.

3. Diagnostic Quiz Evaluation (POST /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/quiz/evaluate):
   - Multiple Choice Questions (question_type="mcq"):
     - Evaluates student choices deterministically against expected answers with zero LLM token cost.
     - Maps incorrect choices to distractor misconception descriptions passed in the request payload.
     - Emits mcq_correct or mcq_miss trace events to both chat and quiz surfaces.
   - Short Reflection Essay Questions (question_type="essay"):
     - Evaluates student responses against a grading rubric using the configured primary LLM model.
     - Parses structured JSON response containing score (0.0 to 1.0), is_correct (boolean), and feedback.
     - Emits essay_eval trace events to both chat and quiz surfaces.
   - Notebook Persistence:
     - Automatically saves all evaluated MCQ and Essay attempts into notebook_entries under session course_{course_id}.

4. Module Capstone Completion (POST /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/modules/{module_id}/complete):
   - Ingests module completion payloads containing learned_concepts, misconceptions, and essay_feedback.
   - Emits a module_completed milestone summary event to L1 chat trace.
   - Consolidates module learning milestones into the student's persistent learning history.
